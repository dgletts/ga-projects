**Overall:**
Great work on this assignment! I don't have many notes for you as of now. Keep moving forward on practicing your Python and brushing up on your fundamental math/stats.

**Some notes**  
* Note in your data dictionary that GRE and GPA are real valued, continuous variables -- not discrete. Given the way that prestige encoded (1, 2, 3, 4), prestige is discrete values (categorical).
